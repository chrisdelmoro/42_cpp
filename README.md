<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The C++ (CPP) project at Ã‰cole 42 is part of the school's curriculum designed to teach students the fundamentals of C++ programming. The project focuses on several key areas:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Students learn about the principles of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

2. **Memory Management**: Proper management of resources is crucial in C++, so the project includes topics like dynamic memory allocation, constructors, destructors, copy constructors, and the Rule of Three/Five.

3. **Standard Template Library (STL)**: The project introduces students to the STL, which includes useful data structures (like vectors, lists, maps, and sets) and algorithms.

4. **Advanced C++ Features**: Topics such as templates, exception handling, and operator overloading are covered to give students a deeper understanding of the language's capabilities.

The CPP project aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to develop complex and efficient C++ applications.
